# messaging-app
A lightweight messaging app that lives inside your GitHub repository.
All messages are stored as commits on a dedicated branch, so conversations stay private, versioned, and alongside your code â€” without any external servers.
Chat securely, keep your discussions auditable, and collaborate directly where your code lives
