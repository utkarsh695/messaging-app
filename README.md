1.About
A lightweight messaging app that lives inside your GitHub repository.
All messages are stored as commits on a dedicated branch, so conversations stay private, versioned, and alongside your code â€” without any external servers.
Chat securely, keep your discussions auditable, and collaborate directly where your code lives

2.Tools Used
This project is simply based on front end development,  which includes  markup languages like - HTML, CSS
and programming language like - JavaScript

3.More briefing
 This project is based on front end development, so to make this project more realistic, we used a fake database
 to showing  the real time chat , so this have only one file named with html,
 in which it includes cascading file and javaScript file.
 There is no seperate files for  HTML, CSS and JavaSript.
